### Hey There
My name is Jorge, I'm a software developer from Colombia, I have a passion for coding and learning new things.
Currently I work on a local startup, I develop software with JavaScript, Kotlin, Python and sometimes .Net technologies.

I'm focusing on python lately because I want to move to Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence on the near future. Not just because it's popular, but because I want to help others by using modern technologies.

### Education
I got my Bachelor’s degree on Computer Science at Universidad de Cordoba, Colombia. I graduated with a thesis about Geolocation and AR for creating a virtual model of my university where people can find common places by searching and getting help to get to the place with a route navigation. We got a calification of 4.5⁄5.0.

### Passions
I have discover a passion for writing, listening to music, and exercising, I find those activities really reliaving, they help me to concentrate and have a better life as a whole.
Besides those passions, I have a passion for coding and creating things, I'm focusing on python because It covers a lot of technologies, like ML/AI, Web development, Scripting and so on.
